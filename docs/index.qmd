## Libraries


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(vegabrite)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

### Exercise 1

- **a. Graphic**

![**Cars**](https://r-graph-gallery.com/275-add-text-labels-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/thecode2-1.png){width=40%}

- **b. What marks are being used? What variables are mapped to which properties?**
   - The marks being used are points. Variables miles per gallon and weight are mapped to the point. Where each point represents a specific car. 
   
- **c. What is the main story of this graphic?**
  - This graphic, I think , is telling us a story about cars fuel efficiency in comparison to their weight. Furthermore, the graphic shows that on the lower the weight  the better the fuel efficiency.
  
- **d. What makes it a good graphic?**
  - For the most part its an easy graphic to interpret. Labels are clear, how ever there is room for improvement. For example, instead of having static labels for the cars it could perhaps be interactive so that you can hover over the points and then the label appears. Right now all the labels appear which means that many overlap, having the labels this way makes it hard to read the car names. 
  
- **e. What features do you think you would know how to implement in Vega-Lite?**
  - I think that I would be able to replicate the graphic.
  
- **f. Are there any features of the graphic that you would not know how to do in Vega-Lite? If so, list them.**
  -  I think I would have to investigate the labels. Although I might be able to make it a layer but if i want to implement the hovering interaction I might have to research a little to try and implement that feature. 

### Exercise 2

- **Create a graphic that shows the mean temperature for each month. How many “months” should you be displaying? (There is more than one answer to this – perhaps try doing it more that one way.)**

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# Reading the data
weather_data<- read_csv("https://calvin-data304.netlify.app/data/weather-with-dates.csv")

# Checking the first few rows of the data
head(weather_data)

# Checking my variables types
str(weather_data$month)
str(weather_data$year)
str(weather_data$temp_min)
str(weather_data$temp_max)
 
# Changing year from numeric to categorical
weather_data$year <- as.factor(weather_data$year)

# Calculating the average mean
weather_data <- weather_data |> mutate(avg_temp = (temp_max + temp_min)/2)

# Grouping by year and month
weather_data <- weather_data |> group_by(year,month)
```

```{r}
  
# Creating the graphics
vl_chart(data = weather_data, height = 400, width = 600) |>
  vl_mark_bar() |>
  vl_encode_x("month", title = "Month", type = "nominal", sort = "ascending") |>
  vl_encode_y("avg_temp", title = "Average Temperature", type = "quantitative", aggregate = "mean" )|>
  vl_encode_xOffset("year")|>
  vl_encode_color("year",scale=list(scheme = "category10"))

```

```{r}
# Creating the graphics
vl_chart(data = weather_data, height = 250, width = 400) |>
  vl_mark_bar() |>
  vl_encode_x("month", title = "Month", type = "nominal", sort = "ascending") |>
  vl_encode_y("avg_temp", title = "Average Temperature", type = "quantitative", aggregate = "mean" )|>
  vl_facet_wrap("year")

```



- **Create a graphic that shows how the different types of weather (rain, fog, etc.) are distributed by month in Seattle. When is it rainiest in Seattle? Sunniest?**

```{r,warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
# Grouping by weather
weather_data <- weather_data |> group_by(weather)

# Creating the graphics
  vl_chart(data = weather_data, height = 400, width = 600) |>
  vl_mark_bar() |>
  vl_encode_x("month", title = "Month", type = "nominal", sort = "ascending") |>
  vl_encode_y(aggregate = "count", title = "Count", type = "quantitative") |>
  vl_encode_color("weather", type = "nominal", title = "Weather Type", ) |>
  vl_encode_xOffset("weather", type = "nominal", title = "Weather Type")


```
